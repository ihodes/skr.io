# TODO


Accept text/plain (e.g. the POST body is the text)
Accept application/json

Use multimethods (with the dispatch function looking at the mimetype in the req!)

Track usage of API
Setup Stripe

Store metadata on texts
  -- curl -X POST ... -dtext=asdasd -dmeta[mime-type]="application/json" -dmeta[foo]=bar

Allow naming of files, expose them publically or privately (need to determine the UX for this)

Map mime-types to responses

e.g.

content-type: text/plain                        -> text/plain
              text/markdown                     -> text/html (with special styling for markdown)
              text/html                         -> text/html (as-is)
              application/json                  -> text/plain (pretty-printed JSON)
              application/xml                   -> application/xml
              application/source-clojure        -> text/html (with special styling for clojure)
              application/source-X              -> text/html (with special styling for X)
              application/x-www-form-urlencoded -> text/plain
              *                                 -> text/plain


allow for ?mime=<mime/type> to force display as a certain mimetype
allow for ?plain url-param to force plaintext response (without pretty printing or anything)
           -- shortcut for ?mime=text/plain


Move to Postgres
